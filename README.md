# Bank_Customers_Churn_Analysis_on_PowerBI


Customer attrition which is also known as Customer churn happens in every business. It’s a bitter truth. However, the churn rate tolerance by any business is one of the parameters that distinguishes who in your industry grows or losses market share.
Depending on industry, a 10 to 12% churn rate is seen as permissible to many. A few years back, I was privileged to make a presentation to a panel at a job interview on customer churn and my first slide read “Grow Fast or Die Slow”. This was to capture the fact that be it customer churn, gross-revenue churn or net-revenue churn, business decision makers should never slack on any of these metrics.
While there are also industry-specific factors such as seasonality impacting customer churn, most churns are as a result to customer dissatisfaction be it poor after sales service; wrong product offering, or less value for pay.
Recommendation to business leaders and non-leaders will be that you deploy your best resources towards retaining existing customers rather to new acquisitions. Research has shown that a 5% reduction in churn could amount to profitability growth of 25% to 90%. Meanwhile most business do not even break even with new customer acquisitions.
The right approach to reducing churn will firstly require its identification. This is best done using data. To demonstrate this, I have pulled data from Kaggle for ten thousand bank customers from France, Spain and Germany. I had used Power BI for the exploratory analysis to see how age, gender, earnings, of these customers reflects in churn rate.
In analyzing the dataset, bulk of my time was on cleaning and creating the model. This required I created one fact and eight-dimension tables from the flat file. I do have a later post which shows how I used ML to predict future churns.

Below were my findings:
Total Data analysis:
•	Of the 10000 bank customers, 2037 were churned
•	55% identify as Male gender
•	51% were active 
•	71% were credit card facility
•	50% lived in France, 25% in Germany and 25% from Spain
•	51% used just 1 of the bank product, 45% used 2 of the bank products, 3% used 3 of the bank products and very insignificant % used above 3 of the bank products.

Churn customer Analysis: Of the 2037 which 20.4% of the total customers,
•	60% identify as females
•	40% lived in France, 40% in Germany and 20% in Spain.
•	69% had just 1 bank product.
•	50% were the bay boomers, 38% were millennials, < 1% were the Gen Z and 8% were the Silent Generation.
•	Customers with Good credit score churned the most while those with excellent credit score churned the least.
•	Customers with high account balance churned the most recording 38% while those with Low account balance churned the least. 

I would close by using the known saying: “It’s cheaper to retain an existing customer than getting a new one”.
 So, to slow down attrition, businesses should pay closer attention to what customers need and offer the exact product/service that meets the need.
 What are your thoughts please?!
